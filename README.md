remote_ssh
==========

Remote SSH commands without console lag on slow connections.

Just run ./control.rb and follow the menu instructions.

This is currently in Alpha, and pull requests are welcomed. Features that dont work but would be awesome are:

## Limitations

* Autocomplete does not work (pressing TAB in SSH)
* You need to authenticate by SSH key and ensure that server is added to known_hosts before starting this app. 
* Ctrl-c will quit out of the script


## Requirements

Ruby 1.9.3
